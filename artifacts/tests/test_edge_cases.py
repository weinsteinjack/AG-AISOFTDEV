"""
Production-grade tests for the Employee Onboarding System API (/users endpoints).

This test suite covers critical edge cases and error handling scenarios for the
user creation (POST) and retrieval (GET) endpoints. It uses FastAPI's TestClient
to simulate HTTP requests and pytest for structuring the tests.

Key Principles Followed:
- Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern: Each test clearly separates setup, execution, and verification.
- Test Isolation: Tests are independent and do not rely on a specific execution order.
- Descriptive Naming: Test function names clearly state the scenario being tested.
- Parameterization: `pytest.mark.parametrize` is used to test multiple invalid inputs
  efficiently, keeping the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Informative Assertions: Assertions include custom messages to aid in debugging failures.
