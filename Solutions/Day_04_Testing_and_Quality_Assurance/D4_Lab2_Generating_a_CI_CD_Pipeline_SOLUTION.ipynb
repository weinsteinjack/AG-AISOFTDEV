We are very specific about the required structure: the `on` trigger, the `jobs` definition, and the `steps` within the job. This level of detail ensures the LLM generates a syntactically correct and logically complete workflow file that is ready to be committed to the repository."

You created the dependency list, the containerization configuration, and the automation workflow, all from simple prompts. This is a powerful demonstration of how AI can automate complex DevOps tasks, allowing teams to build and ship software with greater speed and confidence.\n",
