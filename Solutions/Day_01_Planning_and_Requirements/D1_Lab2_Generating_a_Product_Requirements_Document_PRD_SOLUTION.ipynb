    "### Challenge 3 (Advanced): Programmatic Validation with Pydantic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This is the most advanced challenge. We are now using an LLM to write *code that validates documents*. Generating a Pydantic model turns our document's structure into a testable, code-based standard. This is a form of 'documentation-as-code' that allows for automated governance, ensuring all future PRDs conform to the same reliable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Prompting for Code:** We give the LLM the PRD template and ask it to generate a Pydantic model. Pydantic is a data validation library, and using it to define our document structure turns that structure into a testable, reusable standard.\n",
    "2.  **Saving the Model:** We save the generated Python code to a specific location (`app/validation_models/prd_model.py`). This isn't just a temporary script; it's a formal part of our application's codebase, intended to be used for future validation tasks.\n",
    "3.  **Saving the PRD:** Finally, we save the markdown PRD generated in the intermediate step. This becomes the official `day1_prd.md` artifact for our project."
