    "## Lab Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Fantastic! You have completed a full, end-to-end frontend development workflow using multiple AI agents. You used a vision-powered agent to generate code from a design, a refactoring agent to improve the code's structure, and a critic agent to perform an automated design review. This powerful combination of skills can dramatically accelerate the process of turning visual ideas into functional user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** The workflow of **Generate -> Refactor -> Critique** is a powerful AI-assisted development pattern. Using specialized agents for each step allows you to rapidly create a first draft, improve its quality, and then automatically check it for correctness, significantly speeding up the iteration cycle."
