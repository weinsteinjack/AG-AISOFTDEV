    "### ⭐ Deeper Dive: The \"One-Shot Generation\" Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In the core labs, we often broke down tasks into multiple steps (e.g., generate Pydantic models, then generate endpoints). However, for well-defined, self-contained problems like this URL shortener, you can often generate the entire application in a single prompt. This is the **\"One-Shot Generation\"** pattern, and it's incredibly powerful for rapid prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to successful one-shot generation is a highly-structured and detailed prompt. A great mental model for this is the **PCCTO** framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P - Persona:** Tell the AI *who* it should be. `\"You are an expert Python developer specializing in FastAPI.\"`\n",
    "- **C - Context:** Give it all the background information it needs. `\"You are building a URL shortener service with the following requirements...\"`\n",
    "- **C - Constraints:** Define the boundaries and rules. `\"You must use an in-memory dictionary for storage. The short code must be 6 characters long.\"`\n",
    "- **T - Task:** State the specific action to perform. `\"Generate the complete Python code for a single main.py file.\"`\n",
    "- **O - Output:** Define the exact format of the response. `\"The output must be only the raw Python code, with no explanations.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering this pattern will allow you to create functional application prototypes in seconds."
