    "# Day 7 - Lab 2: Agent Interoperability with A2A Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To provide students with hands-on experience implementing the A2A Protocol, enabling them to build two distinct agents that can discover and communicate with each other in a standardized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 135 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "For agents to collaborate effectively without human intervention, they need a shared language—a standard protocol. The Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol provides this standard, allowing agents to discover each other's capabilities and communicate securely. In this lab, you will build two separate agents: a 'Responder' that offers a service and a 'Requester' that consumes it. Finally, you will integrate this communication into a high-level LangChain agent, bridging the gap between low-level protocols and agentic reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For definitions of key terms used in this lab, please refer to the [GLOSSARY.md](../../GLOSSARY.md)."

    "## Step 1: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will install the `a2a-protocol` library. This lab is unique because it requires running two separate Python scripts simultaneously. You will need to run the Responder agent in one terminal and the Requester agent in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "For the final challenge, where we integrate A2A into a LangChain agent, a model with strong tool-using capabilities like `gpt-4.1`, `o3`, or `gemini-2.5-pro` is recommended."

    "1.  Import the necessary LangChain components (`@tool`, `AgentExecutor`, etc.).\n",

    "5.  Create a LangChain agent and provide it with this new tool.\n",

    "Excellent work! You have successfully implemented the Agent2Agent protocol, creating two distinct agents that can communicate in a standardized way. More importantly, you integrated this low-level communication into a high-level LangChain agent, demonstrating how specialized, protocol-driven agents can be exposed as tools for more general-purpose reasoning agents. This is a key architectural pattern for building complex, interoperable multi-agent systems."
