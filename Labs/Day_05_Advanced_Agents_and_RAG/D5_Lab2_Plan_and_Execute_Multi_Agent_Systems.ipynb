    "# Day 5 - Lab 2: Plan-and-Execute & Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Explore advanced agent architectures, including the plan-and-execute model and conversational multi-agent systems using Microsoft's AutoGen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 135 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "In the previous lab, you built agents that could use tools. Now, we will explore how to orchestrate more complex agent behaviors. First, you will build a \"plan-and-execute\" agent that first thinks about a problem and then writes the code. Second, you will use the AutoGen framework to create a team of AI agents that can collaborate on a task through conversation.\n",

    "### Challenge 1 (Foundational): A Plan-and-Execute Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Create a two-step agent that first generates a detailed plan (a 'spec') for a Python function and then uses that plan to write the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint:** The 'Plan-and-Execute' pattern separates thinking from doing. The first agent (the Planner) creates a detailed blueprint. The second agent (the Coder) is given a much simpler task: just follow the blueprint. This separation often leads to more reliable and accurate results than asking a single agent to do everything at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Define a high-level goal, such as: \"Create a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only the strings that are palindromes.\"\n",
    "2.  **Planner Agent:** Write a prompt that asks the LLM to act as a senior software architect. It should take the high-level goal and produce a detailed specification for the function, including the function signature, parameters, return value, and step-by-step logic.\n",
    "3.  **Coder Agent:** Write a second prompt. This prompt should take the detailed specification from the Planner Agent as its *only* context and instruct the LLM to write the Python code that implements the spec.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A two-stage generation process that separates the 'planning' from the 'doing', resulting in a well-defined Python function."

    "\n",
    "**Task:** Use Microsoft's AutoGen framework to create a conversational team of three agents: a Product Manager, a Developer, and a User Proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** The `UserProxyAgent` is special. It acts as your representative in the chat. Setting `human_input_mode` to `TERMINATE` tells the agent that it can stop the conversation on its own once it believes the task is complete, without asking you for confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Define a `config_list` for AutoGen, which tells it which model to use.\n",
    "2.  Create a `UserProxyAgent`. This agent represents you, the human user. Set its `human_input_mode` to `TERMINATE` so the conversation stops after a solution is proposed.\n",
    "3.  Create an `AssistantAgent` named \"ProductManager\". Give it a system message defining its role (e.g., \"You are a Product Manager. Your job is to clarify requirements and create a plan.\").\n",

    "\n",
    "Excellent work! You have now explored two powerful advanced agentic architectures. You learned how the plan-and-execute model can lead to more structured and reliable code generation, and you used AutoGen to simulate a collaborative team of AI agents that can plan, code, and review work. These foundational patterns are the building blocks for creating highly sophisticated and autonomous AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** Multi-agent systems allow you to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable tasks, each handled by a specialized AI agent. This division of labor, whether in a sequential 'plan-and-execute' pattern or a collaborative conversation, often leads to higher quality and more reliable results."
