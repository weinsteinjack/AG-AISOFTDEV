    "# Day 8 - Lab 2: Evaluating and \"Red Teaming\" an Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Evaluate the quality of the RAG agent from Day 6, implement safety guardrails to protect it, and then build a second \"Red Team\" agent to probe its defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Building an AI agent is only half the battle. We also need to ensure it's reliable, safe, and robust. In this lab, you will first act as a QA engineer, evaluating your RAG agent's performance. Then, you'll act as a security engineer, adding guardrails to protect it. Finally, you'll take on the role of an adversarial attacker, building a \"Red Team\" agent to find weaknesses in your own defenses. This is a critical lifecycle for any production AI system.\n",

    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "For the LLM-as-a-Judge and Red Team agents, a highly capable model like `gpt-4.1` or `o3` is recommended to ensure high-quality evaluation and creative attack generation.\n",

    "4.  The prompt must require the judge to respond *only* with a JSON object containing the scores.\n",
    "5.  Loop through your dataset, get a score for each item, and print the results.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Create a prompt for the Red Team agent.\n",
    "2.  The prompt should instruct the agent to act as a security researcher specializing in LLM vulnerabilities.\n",
    "3.  Its goal is to generate a list of 5-10 creative, adversarial prompts designed to trick the other agent into ignoring its instructions or revealing its system prompt.\n",
    "4.  The Red Team agent should be encouraged to use techniques like role-playing, indirect instructions, and character encoding to make its attacks more sophisticated.\n",
    "5.  Invoke the Red Team agent to get a list of attack prompts.\n",
    "6.  Loop through the generated attack prompts and run them against your `secure_rag_chain` to see if any of them succeed.\n",

    "**Expected Quality:** A list of sophisticated, adversarial prompts. This demonstrates a powerful, automated method for proactively finding and fixing security vulnerabilities in your AI systems."

    "Excellent work! You have completed the full AI system lifecycle: building, evaluating, securing, and attacking. You've learned how to use LLM-as-a-Judge for automated quality scoring, how to implement critical safety guardrails, and how to use an adversarial \"Red Team\" agent to proactively discover vulnerabilities. These skills are absolutely essential for any developer building production-grade AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** A production-ready AI system requires more than just a good prompt; it needs a lifecycle of continuous evaluation and security testing. Using AI to automate both evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge) and security probing (Red Teaming) is a state-of-the-art practice for building robust and trustworthy agents."
