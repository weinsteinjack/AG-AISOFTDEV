    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of building powerful, single agents using LangChain. While the course's Day 5 lab introduced the basics, this session focuses on the internal mechanics, advanced tool creation, and state management to give you a deeper understanding of how to build and debug robust LangChain agents.\n",

    "**Target Audience:** Software engineers attending the AI-Driven Software Engineering Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Concepts Covered:**\n",
    "1.  **Review of Agent Fundamentals:** A quick recap of the `AgentExecutor` and the ReAct (Reason+Act) loop.\n",
    "2.  **Custom Tools in Detail:** Mastering the `@tool` decorator and understanding why a good docstring is the most critical part of a tool.\n",
    "3.  **Agent State & Memory:** Giving your agent conversational memory to handle multi-turn interactions.\n",
    "4.  **Debugging Agent Behavior:** Using `verbose=True` to interpret the agent's thought process and fix issues."
