    "**Objective:** Use the PRD artifact from Day 1 to generate a detailed SQL database schema, create realistic seed data, and then use those outputs to create and seed a live, local database file.\n",

    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to Day 2! Today, we transition from *what* we're building to *how* we'll build it. In this lab, you will act as the lead architect for the Onboarding Tool. Your task is to use the PRD to define the data structure of the application and create a tangible database artifact that will be used for the rest of the course.\n",

    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with different models by changing the `model_name` in `setup_llm_client()`. Models with strong reasoning capabilities, like `gpt-4o`, `o3`, or `gemini-2.5-pro`, are excellent choices for design tasks.\n",

    "- `get_completion()`: To send prompts to the LLM.\n",
    "- `load_artifact()`: To read the PRD from the `artifacts` directory.\n",
    "- `save_artifact()`: To save the generated SQL schema and seed data.\n",
    "- `clean_llm_output()`: To remove markdown fences from the generated SQL code."

You've used an LLM to design a schema, generate realistic test data, and then used a Python script to bring that database to life. This `onboarding.db` file is the foundation upon which we will build our API in Day 3.\n",
