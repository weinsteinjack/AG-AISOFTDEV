    "# Day 2 - Self-Paced Practice: Designing a Real-Time Chat Application\n",

    "**Objective:** Reinforce the concept of diagram-as-code by generating architectural diagrams for a new problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "A key skill for a modern architect is the ability to quickly visualize and communicate system design. In this lab, you will practice using an LLM to generate two different types of diagrams for a common software system: a real-time chat application. This will help you become more fluent in prompting for and interpreting diagrams-as-code."

    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The `utils/plantuml.py` has been updated to:\n",
    "1. Use HTTP instead of HTTPS by default (avoiding SSL issues)\n",
    "2. Automatically disable SSL verification when HTTPS is required\n",
    "3. Provide better error handling and feedback\n",

    "The technique you're using in this lab‚Äîgenerating PlantUML or Mermaid code from a prompt‚Äîis a form of **\"Diagrams as Code.\"** This is a powerful, modern practice with several key advantages over using traditional drag-and-drop GUI tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version Controllable:** Since the diagram is just a text file, you can check it into Git, review changes in pull requests, and track its history alongside your application code.\n",
    "- **Easily Editable:** Modifying a relationship or adding a component is as simple as changing a line of text. This is often much faster than fiddling with boxes and arrows in a GUI.\n",
    "- **Consistent:** Templates and code generation ensure that all diagrams across your organization can share a consistent style and level of detail.\n",
    "- **Automatable:** Because it's text, you can build tools that automatically generate or update architecture diagrams as part of your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring your documentation never goes stale."
