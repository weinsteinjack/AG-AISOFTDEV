      "New hires currently face a fragmented, overwhelming, and often impersonal onboarding experience, leading to decreased initial productivity, a high volume of repetitive questions to HR and managers, and a potential for early disengagement. HR and hiring managers struggle with manual processes, lack visibility into new hire progress, and difficulty in ensuring consistent, role-specific information delivery, resulting in inefficiencies and a suboptimal first impression for new talent.\n",

They receive a generic welcome email, have to fill out stacks of paper forms on their first day, and struggle to find basic information about company policies or their team structure, feeling overwhelmed and unprepared. This often leads to Alex feeling less productive and needing to interrupt colleagues for basic information.\n",
      "- **Persona 2: The Onboarding Orchestrator (Sarah Jenkins)**\n",
      "    *   **Scenario:** Sarah, an HR Coordinator, spends significant time manually sending out welcome packets, chasing down incomplete forms, and answering repetitive questions from new hires. She lacks a centralized system to track new hire progress, customize onboarding paths for different roles, or identify where new hires are struggling, making it difficult to optimize the process and ensure compliance.\n",
      "- **Persona 3: The Knowledge Curator (David Lee)**\n",
      "    *   **Scenario:** David, responsible for internal documentation, finds it challenging to keep onboarding-related information (policies, FAQs, how-to guides) current and easily accessible. Information is scattered across multiple drives and platforms, leading to outdated content and new hires struggling to find accurate answers, increasing the load on support channels.\n",
