    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "With a validated set of user stories, we can now create a higher-level planning document: the PRD. A PRD serves as the source of truth for the product team, outlining the project's purpose, features, and requirements. In this lab, you will use an LLM to synthesize the detailed user stories into this formal document.\n",

You also created a Pydantic model to enforce the structure of this document, introducing automated governance into your workflow.
