      "New hires currently face a fragmented, overwhelming, and often impersonal onboarding experience, leading to decreased initial productivity, a high volume of repetitive questions to HR and managers, and a potential for early disengagement. HR and hiring managers struggle with manual processes, lack visibility into new hire progress, and difficulty in ensuring consistent, role-specific information delivery, resulting in inefficiencies and a suboptimal first impression for new talent.\n",

They receive a generic welcome email, have to fill out stacks of paper forms on their first day, and struggle to find basic information about company policies or their team structure, feeling overwhelmed and unprepared. This often leads to Alex feeling less productive and needing to interrupt colleagues for basic information.\n",
      "- **Persona 2: The Onboarding Orchestrator (Sarah Jenkins)**\n",
      "    *   **Scenario:** Sarah, an HR Coordinator, spends significant time manually sending out welcome packets, chasing down incomplete forms, and answering repetitive questions from new hires. She lacks a centralized system to track new hire progress, customize onboarding paths for different roles, or identify where new hires are struggling, making it difficult to optimize the process and ensure compliance.\n",
      "- **Persona 3: The Knowledge Curator (David Lee)**\n",
      "    *   **Scenario:** David, responsible for internal documentation, finds it challenging to keep onboarding-related information (policies, FAQs, how-to guides) current and easily accessible. Information is scattered across multiple drives and platforms, leading to outdated content and new hires struggling to find accurate answers, increasing the load on support channels.\n",

      "## How to Write a Good Prompt: A Comprehensive Guide\n",
      "\n",
      "Prompt engineering is the art of crafting instructions for AI models to get the desired output. A well-written prompt is clear, specific, and provides enough context for the AI to understand and execute the task effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Core Principles of Effective Prompting\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Clarity:** Be unambiguous. Avoid vague language or assumptions.\n",
      "2.  **Specificity:** Provide details. The more specific you are, the less the AI has to guess.\n",
      "3.  **Context:** Give the AI the necessary background information or the \"why\" behind your request.\n",
      "4.  **Conciseness (but not at the expense of clarity):** Get straight to the point, but don't omit crucial details just to be brief.\n",
      "5.  **Iteration:** Prompting is often an iterative process. Refine your prompt based on the AI's initial responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Elements of a Good Prompt\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of your prompt as a set of instructions for a very intelligent but literal intern.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Role/Persona (Optional but Powerful):**\n",
      "    *   Tell the AI *who* it should act as. This helps it adopt the right tone, knowledge base, and style.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** \"Act as a senior marketing strategist,\" \"You are a friendly, encouraging fitness coach,\" \"As a Python programming expert...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Task/Goal:**\n",
      "    *   Clearly state *what* you want the AI to do. Use strong action verbs.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** \"Write a blog post,\" \"Summarize this article,\" \"Generate 5 ideas,\" \"Translate this text,\" \"Explain the concept of...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Context/Background Information:**\n",
      "    *   Provide any relevant information the AI needs to understand the situation or your request.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** \"I'm writing an email to a potential client who showed interest in our new software,\" \"The target audience is high school students,\" \"This is for a social media campaign about sustainable living.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Specific Instructions & Details:**\n",
      "    *   This is where you add all the nitty-gritty. What should be included? What details are important?\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** \"Focus on the benefits of cloud computing,\" \"Include statistics about renewable energy,\" \"Mention the historical context of the French Revolution,\" \"Discuss both pros and cons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Constraints & Exclusions (What NOT to do):**\n",
      "    *   Tell the AI what to avoid, what to limit, or what not to include. This is crucial for guiding the output.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** \"Keep it under 300 words,\" \"Do not use jargon,\" \"Avoid political commentary,\" \"Only use facts from the provided text.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Format/Output Structure:**\n",
      "    *   Specify how you want the output to be organized.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** \"Format as a bulleted list,\" \"Provide the answer in a table with two columns,\" \"Write a 3-paragraph essay,\" \"Use markdown for headings and bold text,\" \"Generate valid JSON.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Tone & Style:**\n",
      "    *   Describe the desired tone and writing style.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** \"Use a formal and academic tone,\" \"Write in a casual and humorous style,\" \"Be encouraging and motivational,\" \"Maintain a neutral and objective voice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Target Audience (if applicable):**\n",
      "    *   Who is the final output for? This helps the AI tailor the language and complexity.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:** \"For a general audience,\" \"For industry experts,\" \"For elementary school children,\" \"For a business executive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9.  **Examples (Few-Shot Prompting - Powerful!):**\n",
      "    *   If you have a very specific output format or style, providing one or more examples of desired input/output pairs can be incredibly effective.\n",
      "    *   **Example:**\n",
      "        *   `Input: \"apple\"`\n",
      "        *   `Output: \"fruit\"`\n",
      "        *   `Input: \"carrot\"`\n",
      "        *   `Output: \"vegetable\"`\n",
      "        *   `Input: \"chicken\"`\n",
      "        *   `Output: ?` (The AI will likely respond \"meat\")\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advanced Techniques\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Ask the AI to \"think step by step\" or \"explain its reasoning.\" This often leads to more accurate and logical answers, especially for complex tasks.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** \"Explain the process of photosynthesis. First, describe the inputs, then the main steps, and finally the outputs. Think step by step.\"\n",
      "*   **Iterative Prompting/Refinement:** Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Ask the AI to perform one part, then use that output as context for the next prompt.\n",
      "*   **Self-Correction:** Ask the AI to critique its own output based on your initial instructions.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** \"Now, review your answer. Did you meet all the requirements I outlined? If not, please correct it.\"\n",
      "*   **Negative Prompting:** Explicitly state what you *don't* want.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Good Prompt vs. Bad Prompt Examples\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bad Prompt:**\n",
      "\"Write about dogs.\"\n",
      "*Why it's bad:* Too vague, no context, no goal, no format. The AI could write anything from a scientific paper to a poem.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Good Prompt (following the guidelines):**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"**Role:** Act as a friendly and knowledgeable veterinarian.\n",
      "**Task:** Write a 500-word blog post.\n",
      "**Context:** The blog post is for new puppy owners visiting our clinic's website.\n",
      "**Specific Instructions:** Focus on the top 5 essential tips for puppy care during their first year. Cover topics like nutrition, basic training, socialization, and common health concerns.\n",
      "**Tone:** Use an encouraging, warm, and slightly informal tone.\n",
      "**Format:** Structure it with a catchy title, an introduction, five distinct sections for each tip with headings, and a concluding paragraph that includes a call to action to schedule their puppy's first check-up.\n",
      "**Exclusions:** Do not use overly technical medical jargon. Keep sentences relatively short and easy to understand for a general audience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",

    "Excellent work! You have now taken the structured user stories from the first lab and synthesized them into a formal Product Requirements Document. You also created a Pydantic model to enforce the structure of this document, introducing automated governance into your workflow. The `day1_prd.md` artifact will be the primary input for Day 2, where we will begin designing our system's architecture and database.\n",
